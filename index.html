		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Always seeking balance in life, I have often found myself torn between twin passions for art and science. Creative endeavors -- from painting to photography to writing to music -- have always given energy and inspiration to me. Simultaneously, I recognize the immense value of more rigorous, methodical, and objective approaches to the world.</p>
		<br>
		<p>More recently, I have begun to focus on opportunities to apply these twin passions together, seeking ways to use both approaches to enhance each other. From the creative rigors of digital photography to the methodical construction of web design, technology seems to increasingly offer challenges that require strong doses of both "left brain" and "right brain" thinking. I have always considered myself an avid lifelong learner, and it has been profoundly rewarding to find new paradigms and avenues to absorb and explore.</p>
